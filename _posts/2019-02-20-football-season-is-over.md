*Dawn is coming up in Atlantic Station now: 6:09 AM. I can hear the rumble of early morning buses under my window... out here at the far end of Mecaslin: This is the end of the line, for buses and everything else, the northern edge of civilization. From my desk I can see the dark jagged hump of the Millenium Gate looming out of the ocean in the grey morning light. About 200 dogs have been barking out there most of the night.*

I feel exhausted already. No time for sleep. I need to be alert for the hunt.

There had been five or nine very long rainstorms in the past few weeks. I felt it was necessary to follow the normal pattern of showering every few hours, going over the side and staying at the hotel until dark by telephone.

On Wednesday morning I got dressed and went downstairs. Torrential downpours washing all the stinking human filth of Home Park into 10th and State. The sidewalks were submerged somewhere beneath the cesspool of crushed glass, used needles and venereal disease. This was a park for dogs and automobiles, not people.

I thought about the rabid fox living nearby. Plastic signs blocked off either end of a footpath: DO NOT ENTER -- FOX ATTACKS REPORTED -- MAY HAVE RABIES -- WILL TRAVEL. That didn't seem right, but nothing is convincing with psychomimetic agents. The early frontiersmen called it hydrophobia: terror in this tropical rainstorm.

"We can’t both make it across," I said to my colleague grimly. "But seeing as it's essential I get there on time, and dry, why don’t you lie down here: I'll cross on your back and send for assistance right away: we'll need a barge at this rate."

I was shoving him towards the street but he flailed and clawed wildly. "Get out of here! You’re out of your mind." He waved a branch at me. "Why don’t we take my car?"

"Sharks? There aren't any sharks, they wouldn't last a day in this. The water is up to your knees. Not everyone could swim to shore."

"No no, I said my CAR --" he screamed. I surprised him with a powerful jab, sending him sprawling face first. "I'd be careful about what I call business metaphors, pal," I muttered.

He was up now, bristling. "Hey! It's raining!"

"So?"

The trick was to send the Committee into diabetic shock before I started talking. I would sit at a table right next to somebody, and just stare at them -- for all the wrong reasons -- and they'd nod at me, too tense to smile. 

"Any questions?" I would ask and they would stare back bug-eyed and silent, frothing lightly at the mouth. "No? Excellent, excellent, thank you very much. Now just, uh, go to sleep."

A strange, phoneless murmur among the crowd today. I crossed the room. A man in a cowboy hat and green slicker was standing in the arched doorway between the lobby and the garage. "It's raining, I see," he said.

"Yeah."

The Cowboy had managed to make himself unattractive to the public, but he had no stomach for women either. He was so groovy in his new bodyguard's presence that even a cab driver with glasses couldn't miss a beat.

I went back up to the room. A light drizzle was falling. The storm would not be over for an hour or so.

I had a bag of Gypsy pills from the special dispenser right behind me. They took the pills with a huge smile on their faces for two or three seconds, then looked at each other again and said, "We'll give this a ride."

But Something was Wrong. The Committee was awake and in a nasty mood, their facial expressions were so ominous that it was hard to believe them. "We know all that already!" said the cowboy hat. They grunted and snarled. "What about the packing? Or the grinding? How would that change the peaks?"

My mind was getting swampier, my head felt like a giant teddible. Thinking quickly, I listed off a few lists about earth-life support, food, lodging and energy -- then start raving again. But it never even came up.

"It would be a pain in the ass, that's how!" I shrieked. I had to think fast.

I was sweating, hysterical, thick beads of sweat running down my forehead, running into my eyes, burning like acid. I looked around for something to hit them with, but there was nothing -- not even a chair.

"Listen, fellows."

Too early to tell, but there is a lot of talk about the ceiling, the colors: they might not call me a pro, but when they do it is usually a deal-breaker.

As the three of them walked out, I heard them say, "That's one loony we'll have to let go."

The cowboy hat stares straight ahead. “Congratulations, Doctor,” he says. “We saw a great many you.” My Committee? Who was it with them?

Oh yes, the new guy. The new guy who looks like hes been dragged behind a truck for a while. And has yet to blink.

Good luck. He won't have any allies, except for a few corrupt officials, and he will be attacked constantly.

Another half-finished story, another one of stranded and desperate people, another twisted cremation at the circus. I think people perceive that from my finished product, those are two totally different things. All they need is a little edge and a certain amount of courage.

I love steam myself, and I have learned to survive under savage and unnatural pressures. I am a steam freak. There is blood on these walls, and some of it is mine. 

I recall being told, for the first time, that I was the so-called 'chosen one'. As a matter of fact, I remember telling somebody later that I felt sorry for the authorities. They didn't stand a chance.

Well, it depends on what you mean by my personal margin of victory. You can argue about that, for sure, but I guarantee there are some things you can win without much: The ego has always been my bag of worst fears. I hate to admit this sightlessly, but I have learned to live with it. 

No doubt it has something to do with a deep-seated personality defect, or maybe a kink in whatever blood vessel leads into the pineal gland... but I am not optimistic. My powers of premonition have been heightened. I have learned to be a realist about such things.

I am not without a little vanity, but it is kept in check. I suppose this is the balance of things.

It is a new day, now. and I am a survivor. I'm going to go check out the office. I'll see you in a bit.
